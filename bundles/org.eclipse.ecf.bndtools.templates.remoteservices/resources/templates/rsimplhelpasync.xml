<p>This template is used to create a Remote Service Implementation project.  </p>
<p>During project creation with this template, the apipackage/plugin </p>
<p>containing the ExampleRemoteService class declaration must be provided </p>
<p>so that the compile-time references to ExampleRemoteService can be </p>
<p>resolved.  The apipackage/plugin name given should already exist in </p>
<p>the workspace, and may be easily created by using the Remote Service </p>
<p>API project template.  Once created, the new project will have a </p>
<p>class implementing ExampleRemoteService with OSGi Remote Services </p>
<p>service properties for exporting as a remote service.</p>
