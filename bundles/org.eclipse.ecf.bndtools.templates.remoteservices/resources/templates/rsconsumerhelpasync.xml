<p>This template may be used to create a Remote Service Consumer project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During project creation with this template, the apipackage/plugin </p>
<p>containing the ExampleRemoteService class declaration must be </p>
<p>provided so that the compile-time references to ExampleRemoteService </p>
<p>can be resolved. The apipackage/plugin name given should already </p>
<p>exist in the workspace, and may be easily created by using the </p>
<p>Remote Service API project template. Upon creation, the project </p>
<p>will have a class with an ExampleRemoteService interface injected </p>
<p>via DS.   Upon activation, the injected ExampleRemoteService is </p>
<p>called.</p>
