<p>This template may be used to create a Remote Service Consumer project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During project creation with this template, the apipackage/plugin 
containing the ExampleRemoteService class declaration must be 
provided so that the compile-time references to ExampleRemoteService 
can be resolved. The apipackage/plugin name given should already 
exist in the workspace, and may be easily created by using the 
Remote Service API project template. Upon creation, the project 
will have a class with an ExampleRemoteService interface injected 
via DS.   Upon activation, the injected ExampleRemoteService is 
called.</p>
