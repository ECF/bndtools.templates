#ArithmeticTools API 

This project contains the [ArithmeticTools](src/main/java/$basePackageDir$/ArithmeticTools.java) service interface.

ArithmeticTools declares the service contract for an [OSGi Remote Service](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.0.0/service.remoteservices.html).  A remote service impl is exported and published for discovery, and then consumed/used by consumer process.

##Next Step: Create and Start MCP ArithmeticTools Impl Server

An implementation of ArithmeticTools service is created via the MCP ArithmeticTools Impl Server project template. To create a new project using this template choose File->New->Bnd OSGi Project->MCP ArithmeticTools Impl template.

Once the project is created, please see the Readme.md in that project.
