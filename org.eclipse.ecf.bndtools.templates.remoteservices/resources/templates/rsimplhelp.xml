<p>This template is used to create a Remote Service Implementation project.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>During project creation with this template, the apipackage/plugin containing the ExampleRemoteService class declaration </p>
<p>must be provided so that the compile-time references to ExampleRemoteService can be resolved.  The apipackage/plugin name </p>
<p>given should already exist in the workspace, and may be easily created by using the Remote Service API project template.  </p>
<p>Once created, the new project will have a class implementing ExampleRemoteService with OSGi Remote Services </p>
<p>service properties for exporting as a remote service.</p>
