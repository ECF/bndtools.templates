README for zeroconf discovery and generic distribution Bnd Run File

Requirements:  Zeroconf discovery uses LAN-based multicast.  If multicast 
is disabled on the LAN where this bndrun is being used, then discovery 
will not happen.

See README.txt for the steps for starting zeroconf Bnd Run File config.
